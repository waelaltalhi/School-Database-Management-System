📌 Project Overview
This project involves the design and implementation of a relational database system for managing school operations. It was developed to demonstrate proficiency in SQL, database schema design, and data management—core competencies for an MIS (Management Information Systems) professional.

The system efficiently manages data for students, teachers, and academic courses, ensuring data integrity and optimized retrieval.

🚀 Key Features & SQL Skills Applied
Database Schema Design: Created structured tables for Students and Teachers with appropriate primary keys and data types.

Data Population (DML): Managed and inserted records for over 30 students and 10 faculty members.

Data Maintenance: Utilized UPDATE statements to ensure records (such as student emails) remain current and accurate.

Data Querying & Reporting (DQL): Crafted queries using SELECT, ORDER BY, and Aliases to generate clear, actionable reports for school administration.

Problem Solving: Resolved data truncation warnings and handled constraints to maintain high-quality data.

🛠 Tools Used
Database Engine: MySQL

Management Tool: MySQL Workbench

Language: SQL
